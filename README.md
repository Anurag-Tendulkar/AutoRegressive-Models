# AutoRegressive-Models
This code generates an autoregressive time series with added normal noise given its order and initial values. The time series generated is stored in Data.xlsx file. 
Libraries needed to instal - numpy, pandas, openpyxl. To store each time series generated on a new row, specify the row number in variable r.
The default mean and standard deviation of the noise generated is set to 0 and 0.1 respectively.
